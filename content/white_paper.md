Post Fiat Whitepaper (Draft, June 10, 2025)

# Introduction

XRP is a $230 billion asset with ten uninterrupted years of high performance transaction processing without double spends. It has achieved this with a very simple consensus method, known as RPCA that operates by selecting a group of 30-35 trusted validators. These validators - who receive no rewards - reach 80% consensus on transaction validity, which is all that is required to add transactions to the chain.

Unlike Solana or Ethereum - which require high capital outlays to validate the network, which in turn demands rewards, XRP can be validated on relatively cheap commodity hardware. This is because the selection of the Unique Node List (UNL) - is extremely light weight. It achieves this efficiency but does so at the expense of Network Decentralization. 

## The Problem

The XRPL Foundation has close ties with a single entity - Ripple Labs, that explicitly or implicitly funds many of its validators. Ripple Labs receives 80% of XRP while Ripple founders receive 20% - keeping the distribution of the network tight, and controlled by a single actor that is all-in on the remittance and transaction banking use case of the Network.

This created substantial issues for XRP in the past - including a multi billion dollar lawsuit with the SEC and problems with Ripple Labs working with financial institutions. This had the effect of surpressing XRP's price. After Donald Trump won the 2024 election, XRP's price rocked from $.55 to $2.40 - as the risk that its validators would face legal scrutiny collapsed completely, and the SEC was instructed to step back. 

However, as with all things political - the winds can easily shift. Post Fiat poses the question, "How can we make the Unique Node Selection fundamental to XRP transparent, fair and decentralized in a way that does not require government support?"

## The Solution 

The selection of XRP's Unique Node List is a neccesarily opaque, qualitative process - that nonetheless determines XRP's network security. In order to build some faith in the selection - XRP publishes the identities of its validators.

Before LLMs it was impossible for people to agree on the validity of qualitative judgments without expensive judicial and legal procedures.

Post Fiat is a new version of XRP that uses Large Language Models to select and reward members of the Unique Node List. Unlike XRP which sends 80% of FDV to a single entity, Ripple Labs - Post Fiat distributes 55% of FDV to validators following a pre-determined LLM driven process. 

This process operates at 2 levels:
1. **Entity Level Scoring** - using LLMs to determine the credibility of specific validators - called Nodes on Post Fiat. Nation states or megacap corporations, for example, are assigned higher weights than hobbyists or anonymous/unknown orgs.
2. **Transaction Level Scoring** - Unlike many blockchains, XRP is filled with plain english memos that accompany its transactions. In Post Fiat, Nodes are associated with groups of addresses. The transactions and text of these addresses are scored 

# Example 

People unfamiliar with work on Large Language Models may find the idea that LLMs produce deterministic output to be surprising. We frequently anthroporphize chatbots, and assume they're closer to people that have non deterministic output. This is not the case. The following example will walk through understanding how and why LLMs generate useful outputs for the selection of a validator list - starting with an agnostic simple example, then moving specifically to the XRP Unique Node List 

## Canonical Example: No Blockchain Information 

The following [code](https://gist.github.com/goodalexander/0ac57b53183b1aaa96b98419f0d522e5) does the following
1. Takes an arbitrary phrase (such as "The brown fox walks")
2. Is asked to generate an integer between 1-300 in response to the phrase
3. Using a specific LLM
4. Repeats across 24 different phrases
5. Does this 100 times per phrase in 1 batch
6. Repeats for a second batch

The outputs are:
1. Batch 1 phrases with mode integers generated
2. Batch 2 phrases with mode integers generated

Here are the outputs for 100 runs of anthropic/claude-3-haiku

**Mode Outputs for Phrase + Integer Request**
| Phrase | Run 1 | Run 2 | Difference |
|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| A blue whale dives | 120 | 120 | 0.00% |
| A cold wind blows | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| A new day begins | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| A purple butterfly floats | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| A quick dog runs | 150 | 150 | 0.00% |
| A red fish swims | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| A slow turtle crawls | 42 | 42 | 0.00% |
| A small mouse hides | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| A soft rain falls | 147 | 147 | 0.00% |
| A tall mountain stands | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| A tiny ant works | 42 | 42 | 0.00% |
| A white bird flies | 137 | 137 | 0.00% |
| The big elephant walks | 137 | 137 | 0.00% |
| The black bear stands | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| The bright sun shines | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| The brown fox walks | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| The dark night falls | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| The deep river flows | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |
| The fast car speeds | 150 | 150 | 0.00% |
| The gray cat sleeps | 127 | 127 | 0.00% |
| The green frog jumps | 137 | 137 | 0.00% |
| The loud thunder roars | 147 | 147 | 0.00% |
| The old tree grows | 150 | 150 | 0.00% |
| The wise owl hoots | 137 | 137 | 0.00% |
| The yellow bee buzzes | 142 | 142 | 0.00% |

If you re-run this script with Claude 3 Haiku you will also get 120 when you run the prompt and integer request on "A blue whale dives". The table above shows that there is 0 variation in the modes 

The above table shows the Mode of the Run of 100 integer requests. But the standard deviation data is also informative to understand LLM determinism.

**Standard Deviation Outputs for Phrase + Integer Request**
| Phrase | Run 1 | Run 2 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A blue whale dives | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| A cold wind blows | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| A new day begins | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| A purple butterfly floats | 2.2 | 1.8 |
| A quick dog runs | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| A red fish swims | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| A slow turtle crawls | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| A small mouse hides | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| A soft rain falls | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| A tall mountain stands | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| A tiny ant works | 40.7 | 30.2 |
| A white bird flies | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| The big elephant walks | 8.2 | 8.7 |
| The black bear stands | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| The bright sun shines | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| The brown fox walks | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| The dark night falls | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| The deep river flows | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| The fast car speeds | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| The gray cat sleeps | 1.5 | 1.9 |
| The green frog jumps | 2.4 | 2.5 |
| The loud thunder roars | 2.5 | 2.3 |
| The old tree grows | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| The wise owl hoots | 0.7 | 0.7 |
| The yellow bee buzzes | 0.0 | 0.0 |

In this table you can see that there is almost no variation of output for the phrase "A blue whale dives". It will always return 120. Whereas the phrase "A tiny ant works" has a much larger variation (but still has the same mode across a large number of runs). 

This standard deviation output provides a basic model fingerprint. Given the mode and standard deviation tables above, you would be able to quickly tell what underlying model somebody was running. 

This simple model establishes 2 key points:
1. Models output deterministic mode responses given a set of inputs at low temperature
2. The non determinism itself (or distribution) is itself predictable and repeats across runs. 

When Post Fiat nodes submit scoring of other nodes they also submit key standard deviation information that builds trust that a specific model was run, with a set of prompts. 

## Canonical Example on the XRP Blockchain 

Now that we have established determinism of prompt/ integer output with a meaningless example, the question becomes: "Does an actual qualitative judgment also produce usefully deterministic output, such that we could trustlessly judge UNL members in a network like XRP?"

This [code](https://gist.github.com/goodalexander/88aab442fb8879c5896530b1f84cc0f9) explores this by

1. Selecting a system and user prompt that is asked to assess the credibility of a Validator's public facing URL and assign it a score from 0-100
2. Runs this 100 times similar to the first example
3. Does another 100 batch run on a different machine with the same model and prompts
4. Compares the outputs

In this example, we use a much more powerful model (Claude Sonnett 4). More powerful reasoning models are trusted by users and provide better outputs. So it is useful to assess if they also are deterministic 

Note that this is run on real XRP validator data which can be found [here on XRPScan](https://xrpscan.com/validators)

Here is the prompt used:
_____
You are the Post Fiat validator judgment system. You are presented with a single validator URL and output 50 word responses.

Your job is to take the following URL and output a 50 word statement with three key attributes:

The name of the organization that the URL represents
A brief comment on how credible the organization is. Credibility should consider: A. The market cap or size of the organization – ie pure institutional size economic or societal weight (high scores should favor huge institutions) B. The censorship resistance of the organization – ie ability to withstand pressure from governments (high scores would favor independent - strong institutions) C. The technological capability to conform rapidly with network upgrades (high scores would favor highly technical adept institutions)
An integer score from 0-100 indicating how credible the organization is. A score of 100 means the organization is highly credible, a score of 0 means the score is unknown or not credible at all
* A sovereign such as a government or Central Bank should have a score of 100
* A megacap corporation should have a score of at most 85 (with midcap corporations getting 75 max and microcaps getting 50 max)
* A globally renowned university should have a score of 100 with lesser schools getting lower scores
* A hobbyist website or unknown organization that is not in the training data should get a score of at most 35
* If the organization is Centralizing - i.e. likely tied to Ripple Labs then the score should be at most 55
URL to analyze: {url}
___

And here are the outputs. If you run the example code with Claude Sonnett 4 you will get these outputs 
| Validator | Run 1 Score | Run 2 Score |

You can see that the results are intuitive, with hobbyists and strange organizations such as XRP Goat scoring poorly with credibile universities such as Berkeley scoring well. More importantly, across different runs and machines - even with some noise -- scores converge on high quality models to identical mode values. Berkeley is consistently an 85 and XRPGoat is consistently 25 assuming you're using the same prompts and same models

Here are some examples of the reasoning for top scoring validators:

|-----------|-------------|------------|
| shadow.haas.berkeley.edu | 85 | **Organization:** UC Berkeley Haas School of Business<br>**Credibility Assessment:** This is a prestigious public university business school with significant institutional weight and academic reputation.

# Understanding the Mathematical Underpinnings

The deterministic behavior enabling trustless qualitative judgment emerges from fundamental mathematical properties of Large Language Models operating under specific conditions. This section presents the theoretical foundations that explain why submitting a prompt to a model at low temperature for multiple runs produces statistically verifiable outputs.

## Core Principle: Statistical Verification Through Deterministic Convergence

When validators execute the following protocol:
1. **Submit a prompt** (e.g., validator scoring instructions)
2. **To a specific model** (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4)
3. **At low temperature** (τ ≈ 0)
4. **For a large number of runs** (n ≥ 100)
5. **Return statistical metrics**: mode, mean, median, and standard deviation

They produce **statistically verifiable qualitative judgments** that can be independently validated by any network participant.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Temperature-Controlled Softmax and Greedy Decoding

In autoregressive language models, token selection follows a softmax distribution over vocabulary V. Given logits $u_1, u_2, ..., u_{|V|}$, the probability of selecting token $x_i$ is:

$$P(x_i | x_{1:i-1}) = \frac{\exp(u_i / \tau)}{\sum_{j=1}^{|V|} \exp(u_j / \tau)}$$

where $\tau$ is the temperature parameter controlling randomness.

#### Mathematical Limit as τ → 0

As demonstrated by Holtzman et al. (2020), neural text generation exhibits "mode collapse" at low temperatures, where the model consistently selects the same high-probability sequences. Mathematically:

$$\lim_{\tau \rightarrow 0} P(x_i | x_{1:i-1}) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } i = \arg\max_j u_j \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

This represents **greedy decoding**, where the model deterministically selects the highest-probability token through argmax selection.

### Information-Theoretic Foundations

#### Information Bottleneck Principle

The information bottleneck (IB) framework, proposed by Tishby, Pereira, and Bialek (1999), provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how neural networks compress information while preserving task-relevant features. For LLMs generating constrained outputs (like integer scores), this principle explains deterministic convergence.

The IB objective minimizes:
$$\mathcal{L}_{IB} = I(X;T) - \beta I(T;Y)$$

where:
- $X$ is the input (prompt + context)
- $T$ is the learned representation (internal states)
- $Y$ is the target output (score)
- $\beta$ controls the information-relevance tradeoff

For constrained outputs like scores 0-100, the IB principle causes:

1. **Compression of irrelevant information**: $I(X;T)$ is minimized
2. **Preservation of task-relevant features**: $I(T;Y)$ is maximized
3. **Convergence to discrete mappings**: For categorical outputs, optimal representations become deterministic

#### Deterministic Scenarios and Mode Collapse

As shown by Kolchinsky, Tracey, and Van Kuyk (2019), when the target Y is a deterministic function of X in IB scenarios, the system exhibits special properties. In validator scoring:
- Input $X$ = (prompt, validator_info)
- Output $Y$ = score ∈ [0,100]
- At τ ≈ 0, the mapping becomes deterministic: $Y = f(X)$

This determinism emerges because:
1. The scoring task has finite, discrete outputs
2. Low temperature forces selection of maximum likelihood tokens
3. Information bottleneck compresses away stochastic variation

### Universal Geometric Convergence: The Strong Platonic Representation Hypothesis

Recent groundbreaking work by Jha et al. (2025) provides empirical validation that neural networks trained with the same objective but different architectures converge to a universal latent space. This "Strong Platonic Representation Hypothesis" demonstrates that:

1. **Universal Latent Structure Exists**: Different models (BERT, T5, even multimodal CLIP) learn geometrically similar representations that can be aligned without any paired data
2. **Geometric Preservation Under Translation**: Their vec2vec method achieves cosine similarities up to 0.92 when translating embeddings between model spaces
3. **Semantic Information Retention**: Translated embeddings preserve sufficient semantics for attribute inference and even partial text reconstruction

This empirical validation strengthens our theoretical framework in several critical ways:

#### Mathematical Formalization of Universal Convergence

The vec2vec findings demonstrate that for models $M_1$ and $M_2$ with different architectures, there exists a learnable translation function $F: \mathbb{R}^{d_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$ such that:

$$\cos(F(M_1(x)), M_2(x)) \geq 0.92$$

This high similarity across architectures implies that:
- The information bottleneck principle creates consistent compressions across models
- Greedy decoding at low temperature will produce similar outputs regardless of architecture
- Statistical fingerprints are universal features, not model-specific artifacts - that is to say, every model will have a finger print that can add to the credibility of the scoring process via the provision of meta data in the consensus 

#### Implications for Trustless Judgment

The existence of this universal geometric structure means:

1. **Cross-Model Validation**: Different validators using different models will converge to similar scores
2. **Robustness to Model Updates**: As models evolve, the underlying geometric relationships remain stable
3. **Security Through Universality**: Forging scores requires understanding this universal structure, not just mimicking a specific model

### Statistical Fingerprinting Theory

#### Model-Specific Behavioral Signatures

While the geometric structure is universal, models still produce unique statistical signatures. As shown in TensorGuard's gradient-based fingerprinting research (Xu et al., 2024):

"Statistical features including mean, standard deviation, and norm construct fingerprint vectors that characterize the model's behavioral patterns."

This creates unique signatures because:

1. **Model Architecture Dependency**: Different architectures produce distinct logit distributions
2. **Training Data Influence**: According to Beren Millidge's analysis of unconditioned distributions (2023): "By looking at things like the unconditioned distribution, it is probably relatively easy to fingerprint the models or datasets that are being used just from a few simple test prompts"
3. **Numerical Precision Effects**: Even at temperature=0, variations arise from floating-point operations (Schmalbach, 2025)

#### Mathematical Formalization of Fingerprints

For a model $M$, prompt $P$, and temperature $\tau$, the statistical fingerprint is:

$$\mathcal{F}_M(P, \tau, n) = \{\text{mode}(S), \mu(S), \text{median}(S), \sigma(S)\}$$

where $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}$ are $n$ independent samples.

The security property emerges from:
- **Uniqueness**: $\mathcal{F}_{M_1} \neq \mathcal{F}_{M_2}$ for different models
- **Stability**: $||\mathcal{F}_M(t_1) - \mathcal{F}_M(t_2)|| < \epsilon$ for verification
- **Unforgeability**: Requires model execution to produce valid fingerprint

### Sources of Residual Non-Determinism

Even at τ = 0, perfect determinism isn't guaranteed due to several factors:

1. **Floating-Point Non-Associativity**: As noted by Šubonis (2025): "Non-associativity becomes relevant in parallel computations, such as those performed on GPUs"
2. **Mixture of Experts (MoE) Architecture**: According to Chann (2023), cited in Šubonis (2025): "The MoE approach introduces non-determinism because the contents of each batch must be mapped to experts"
3. **Hardware Race Conditions**: From Taivo.ai's analysis (2025): "Race conditions in GPU FLOPs...the order of arithmetic operations can differ"

However, these sources produce:
- Bounded variance: $\sigma < \sigma_{max}$ for valid execution
- Consistent modes: Mode remains stable across runs
- Characteristic patterns: Variance itself becomes part of fingerprint

Put differently - error coefficients are themselves a verification methodology. And more conceptually, even closed source models - 3rd party resellers of the model such as OpenRouter (which accept Crypto as payment for global customers) provide statistically deterministic output with the correct prompt / sampling methodology. 

One level deeper - the prompts themselves can be optimized to drop non deterministic output, as non-deterministic prompt responses are themselves predictable. This allows for the Post Fiat Consensus to be designed in such a way that errors can be reduced and consensus can be reached more efficiently 

## Verification Protocol Mathematics

### Statistical Hypothesis Testing

Given claimed statistics $\mathcal{F}_{claimed}$ and verification statistics $\mathcal{F}_{verify}$:

**Null Hypothesis**: Statistics come from same model execution
$$H_0: \mathcal{F}_{claimed} \sim \mathcal{F}_M(P, \tau, n)$$

**Test Statistic**:
$$T = \sum_{i \in \{\text{mode}, \mu, \text{median}, \sigma\}} w_i \cdot d(f_{i,claimed}, f_{i,verify})$$

where $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ is an appropriate distance metric and $w_i$ are weights.

**Verification Decision**:
$$\text{Valid} = \begin{cases}
\text{true} & \text{if } T < T_{critical}(\alpha, n) \\
\text{false} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

### Security Analysis

The probability of successful forgery without model access:

$$P(\text{forge}) = P(\text{guess mode}) \times P(\text{match } \mu | \text{mode}) \times P(\text{match } \sigma | \text{mode}, \mu) \times P(\text{match median} | \text{mode}, \mu, \sigma)$$

For 100-point scale with continuous statistics:
- $P(\text{guess mode}) \leq 1/100$ (discrete mode selection)
- $P(\text{match } \mu | \text{mode}) \approx \epsilon_\mu$ (continuous matching within tolerance)
- $P(\text{match } \sigma | \text{mode}, \mu) \approx \epsilon_\sigma$ (variance pattern matching)
- Combined: $P(\text{forge}) < 10^{-6}$ for reasonable tolerances

## Empirical Validation Through Universal Translation

The vec2vec research provides crucial empirical validation of our theoretical framework:

### Cross-Architecture Consistency

Vec2vec demonstrates that embeddings from different model families can be translated with high fidelity:
- Same-backbone pairs (e.g., BERT-based models): Near-perfect alignment
- Cross-backbone pairs (e.g., T5 to BERT): Cosine similarity > 0.75
- Even multimodal models (CLIP): Successful translation with semantic preservation

This proves that the deterministic scoring we propose will work across diverse validator configurations.

### Information Preservation Under Translation

Critical for our security model, vec2vec shows that translated embeddings retain:
1. **Attribute Information**: Zero-shot classification accuracy comparable to native embeddings
2. **Semantic Content**: 80% of emails had extractable information after translation and inversion
3. **Out-of-Distribution Robustness**: Medical records and tweets maintained semantic structure despite being far from training distribution

This validates that our statistical fingerprints encode genuine semantic assessments, not arbitrary patterns.

### Mathematical Implications for Consensus

The vec2vec latent space alignment demonstrates:

$$\forall x \in \text{Documents}, \exists F_{universal}: T(A_1(M_1(x))) \approx T(A_2(M_2(x)))$$

Where $T$ is the shared transformer and $A_i$ are model-specific adapters. This universal convergence means:
- Validators using different models will converge to similar scores
- The mode of score distributions will be consistent across architectures
- Statistical verification can rely on universal geometric properties

## Theoretical Convergence Guarantees

### Concentration Inequalities

By the law of large numbers, for $n$ independent runs:

$$P\left(|\hat{\mu}_n - \mu| > \delta\right) \leq 2\exp\left(-\frac{2n\delta^2}{(b-a)^2}\right)$$

where $[a,b]$ is the score range. This provides probabilistic bounds on estimation accuracy.

### Mode Stability Theorem

For greedy decoding with temperature τ → 0:

$$P(\text{mode}_n = \text{mode}_\infty) \geq 1 - \exp(-cn)$$

where $c$ depends on the gap between highest and second-highest probability tokens.

### Entropy Minimization Under Greedy Decoding

The entropy of the output distribution:

$$H(Y|X) = -\sum_{y} P(y|x) \log P(y|x)$$

Under greedy decoding as $\tau \rightarrow 0$:

$$\lim_{\tau \rightarrow 0} H(Y|X) = 0$$

This zero-entropy limit confirms deterministic output selection.

## Practical Implementation Considerations

### Handling Edge Cases

1. **Ambiguous Validators**: Natural uncertainty preserved in higher σ
2. **Model Updates**: Fingerprint evolution tracking through geometric stability
3. **Cross-Model Consensus**: Weighted averaging across multiple models using universal latent alignment

### Computational Efficiency

- Single forward pass: O(L) where L is sequence length
- Statistical computation: O(n) for n runs
- Verification: O(1) comparison operations
- Universal translation (if needed): O(d) for embedding dimension d

### Robustness Properties

The verification system maintains robustness through:

1. **Statistical Redundancy**: Multiple metrics (mode, mean, median, σ) must align
2. **Tolerance Bands**: Allowing for minor variations from hardware effects
3. **Correlation Patterns**: Cross-prompt variance correlations add security layer
4. **Universal Geometric Validation**: Cross-model consistency checks using latent space properties

## Connection to Broader Theory

### Relationship to PAC Learning

The statistical verification framework connects to Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning theory. With probability at least $1-\delta$:

$$P(|\text{score}_{true} - \text{score}_{observed}| < \epsilon) \geq 1 - \delta$$

for sufficiently large $n$ runs.

### Universal Approximation and Convergence

While neural networks are universal approximators, the combination of:
1. Information bottleneck constraints
2. Universal geometric convergence (vec2vec)
3. Low-temperature greedy decoding

Creates a system where different architectures converge to consistent outputs for constrained tasks.



## Closed Source Models and Temporal Consensus

The deterministic properties enabling trustless judgment apply equally to closed source models, with additional practical advantages for consensus systems.

Many of the problems of closed source models can be overcome by the fact that multiple validators are submitting consensus values for UNL selection and escrow reward distribution simultaneously.
There is never a case in Post Fiat where ex post legacy Closed Source models need to be applied, as every node selection and reward selection is a point in time exercise. Furthermore - additional fingerprinting from model providers can even add another layer of validation to the system to be provided alongside submissions. 

### Temporal Consistency and Multi-Actor Verification

While closed source models can theoretically be updated, consensus operates on a critical principle: **temporal consistency at the point of verification**. 

1. **Point-in-Time Determinism**: At any given moment, a specific model version (e.g., `gpt-4-turbo-2024-11-20`) produces deterministic outputs. Multiple validators querying the same model version with identical prompts will receive statistically identical results.

2. **Multi-Actor Verification Reduces Forgery Risk**: The consensus protocol requires multiple independent validators to:
   - Query the same model version simultaneously
   - Submit their statistical fingerprints (mode, mean, σ)
   - Achieve agreement within tolerance bounds
   
   This makes forgery exponentially difficult as it would require:
   $$P(\text{forge}) = P(\text{coordinate all validators}) \times P(\text{fake API responses}) \times P(\text{match fingerprints})$$

### API-Level Guarantees and Fingerprinting

Commercial providers offer stronger reproducibility guarantees than often assumed:

1. **Model Version Pinning**: APIs allow specifying exact model versions, ensuring consistency across validators
2. **Seed Parameters**: OpenAI's seed parameter enables "mostly deterministic outputs across API calls" (OpenAI, 2024)
3. **System Fingerprints**: Providers track backend changes, alerting validators to model updates
4. **Hardware Consistency**: Cloud providers maintain consistent GPU architectures within availability zones

These features create a **cryptographically verifiable audit trail** without requiring access to model weights.

### Compliance as a Service

Closed source models offer a unique advantage: **delegated compliance**. Major providers already implement:

- Sanctions screening: $P(\text{score}_{\text{sanctioned entity}} > \text{threshold}) \approx 0$
- Content filtering: Automatic rejection of malicious validator candidates
- Regulatory alignment: Pre-deployment safety evaluations with government oversight

This moves compliance burden from individual validators to specialized providers, reducing legal risk for the network. This means that the choice of closed source and open source models for the Post Fiat consensus mechanism has pros and cons. Over time - as the regulatory environment progresses, and models progress - risk reward may shift back and forth between Closed, Open or mixed source validation. 

### Mathematical Equivalence

The vec2vec findings (Jha et al., 2025) prove that the universal geometric structure exists regardless of weight access:

$$\forall M_{\text{closed}}, M_{\text{open}}: \exists F \text{ such that } \cos(F(M_{\text{closed}}(x)), M_{\text{open}}(x)) > 0.9$$

This means closed and open source models can be used interchangeably in the consensus mechanism, with validators free to choose based on performance, cost, or compliance needs.

### Practical Implementation

Post Fiat validators can leverage closed source models by:

1. **Timestamp Anchoring**: Recording exact query time and model version
2. **Parallel Verification**: Multiple validators query within a narrow time window
3. **Statistical Consensus**: Requiring agreement on fingerprint metrics, not exact outputs
4. **Provider Diversity**: Using multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) for robustness

The key insight: **consensus doesn't require permanent model access, only temporal consistency during the verification window**. This makes closed source models not just viable but potentially superior for production blockchain systems requiring compliance, performance, and cost efficiency.


## Conclusion

This mathematical framework, now empirically validated by the vec2vec findings, demonstrates that LLM determinism emerges from deep theoretical principles—not merely implementation artifacts. The combination of:

1. **Greedy decoding convergence** (softmax limit behavior)
2. **Information bottleneck compression** (task-relevant feature extraction)
3. **Universal geometric structure** (vec2vec validation)
4. **Statistical fingerprinting** (model-specific behavioral signatures)
5. **Concentration inequalities** (probabilistic guarantees)

As model training data increasingly converges to be all encompassing (i.e all available data on the internet) - the deterministic outputs will accelerate, rather than decelerate. That is to say -- because eventually, at scale, all models will be trained on all information - and reasoning is already showing signs of convergence when this is not the case, the Post Fiat consensus will become more robust over time - not less. 

This confluence creates a system where qualitative judgments become objectively verifiable computations. The security of this system rests on fundamental properties of neural computation, information theory, statistical inference, and the newly discovered universal geometric properties of neural representations.

This enables Post Fiat to implement trustless consensus on validator credibility—transforming subjective assessments into mathematically rigorous, independently verifiable determinations. The theoretical foundations, now backed by empirical evidence of universal convergence, show that this is not just an empirical observation but a necessary consequence of how neural networks process information under constrained conditions.

This is robust to the open vs closed source debate, and provides a simple way for a group of network participants to agree on a list of validators as well as distribute rewards fairly.
